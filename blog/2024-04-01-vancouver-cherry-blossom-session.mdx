In 2024, I was living in Burnaby. I had to commute to downtown Vancouver for school during the cherry blossom season. And I took some pictures on the way.

First day at school and lunch time. I bought a burrito near the Burrard Station. There was a cherry blossom tree.

One day, after the rain.

The cherry blossoms have almost fallen and begun to sprout. This picutre is my favorite from this cherry blossom season.
